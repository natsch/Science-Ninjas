					<h3>In the game, Acids and Bases react to form Salt and Water, and Deadly Carbonyls and Water react to form an Acid and CO2. Are these both real reactions?</h3>
					<img src="../images/valence/reaction.jpg" class="img-responsive">
					<p>Yes! The acid / base reaction or acid / metal oxide reactions are common reactions for students to learn about in school (metal oxides are bases too actually!) and they create a salt and water when they combine as: NaOH + HCl -> H2O + NaCl. Typically the reaction between water and a deadly carbonyl looks like this: COCl2 + H2O -> CO2 + 2HCl (in this case the Deadly Carbonyl is COCl2 - phosgene!). In Valence, all our reactions happen in nature, but the stoichiometry isn’t always perfect, since if you really had a phosgene and a water, you should technically get 2 acids.

								<h3>What are Deadly Carbonyls? And are they really deadly?</h3>
								<img src="../images/valence/deadlycarbonyls.jpg" class="img-responsive">
								<p>Carbonyls are molecules that have a C=O bond. In the first version of Valence, all the molecules that you can make include halogens (Cl and F), but in real life you can have many different type of carbonyls, some with metals even. Many of them are deadly, but in different ways. For instance Phosgene (COCl2) has been used as a chemical weapon, particularly during WWI. Ketones like Formaldehyde or Metal Carbonyls are often carcinogenic.</div>

			<h3>I can make NaKO in the game - is that a real molecule?</h3>
							<img src="../images/valence/reaction.jpg" class="img-responsive">
								<p>One of our science advisors Cantwell responded to this one: “They (Na2O and K2O) both have the same space group, cF12. So I imagine there is some solid solubility, but I can’t find the binary phase diagram.” In other words, we decided that it could be a metal oxide, it just might be very hard to make in the lab...(and it’s still kind of hard to make in Valence!)</div>
